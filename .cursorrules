put components first
// Use Tailwind CSS for styling

put all imports and stuff at the bottom
// Use Hono/jsx for rendering HTML

// back buttons should always be ".." or sometimes "javascript:history.back()" for post submissions - not "../" and especially not "."
// sub links shuold always be "item/" not "item" - that means all pages should be "example.com/page/" not "example.com/page"

// req params: 
// parent
//    | :recipe
//     - recipe

// all non page templates should all be like "delete" "create" "update" "share"
// no "/delete/:id" or "/delete/" just "./delete" which can be simplified to "delete"
// this works because all pages end with a "/", like "item/"

// but what about /recipes/:id/delete?? from the recipes page?

// also make sure to log all CRUD operations
